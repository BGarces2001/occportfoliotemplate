  text: `After graduating with a degree in <strong>Accounting</strong>, I decided to pursue my passion for programming. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and learned <strong>full-stack web development</strong>. <em>My favorite part of programming</em> is the problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack is React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. I am also familiar with TypeScript and Prisma. I am always looking to learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a full-time position as a software developer.<br /> <em>When I'm not coding</em>, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and playing with my dog. I also enjoy <strong>learning new things</strong>. I am currently learning about <strong>history and philosophy</strong>. I'm also learning how to play the guitar.`,
